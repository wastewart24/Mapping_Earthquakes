# Mapping_Earthquakes
#### The client has asked for me to create earthquake maps using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data. They want to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
